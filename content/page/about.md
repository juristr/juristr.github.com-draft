## Freelance Consulting

I'm also a freelance trainer and consultant mostly around topics such as **frontend development**, **Angular** and **Git**. Interested? Feel free to <a href="mailto:&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#064;&#106;&#117;&#114;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;" target="_blank">reach out to me</a>.

## Current Interests
<a name="interests"></a>

I have a variety of interests in the field of computer science. Right now I'm mostly focusing on the frontend web development, experimenting with the latest technology like web components, custom elements, progressive web apps and using frameworks like Angular.

Another passion of mine have always been software architectures, which is why I closely also follow the world of Microservices, distributed architectures, containerization etc.

## Aside from software dev?

I'm trying to spend as much quality time as possible with my family. Moreover I'm passionate about sports, especially calistenics and martial arts. I've been practicing Yoseikan Budo for roughly over 19 years now. I'm the owner of a 3rd Dan black belt and I also regularly teach martial arts classes.
