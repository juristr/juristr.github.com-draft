Yes, this is another article about learning ES2015 (known as ES6). It's my journey of learning it, as well as my personal notepad for new stuff I discover along the way. Feel free to suggest new or missing sections or [contribute to this article](https://github.com/juristr/juristr.github.com/edit/master/_posts/2015-08-26-jump-start-es2015.md). It's open source and on GitHub :smirk:.

Right away before starting, you may also want to take a look at other good articles related to learning ES2015. A collection of good links is at the end of the article. Suggest me new ones if I don't have them yet.

## Browser compatibility

ES6 or ES2015 how it's officially called now has been [released on June 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/). As such browsers start implementing its features. Some are already at a good level which you can easily online. [Kangax is one example](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) of showing the current browser support.

Regardless of browser support, from now on, people will have to rely on transpilers which make sure your code runs smoothly even if the underlying browser does not fully support all of the latest language features. Why's that? Well, with the name **ES2015**, the [TC39 committee](http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm) clearly suggests more frequent, yearly releases. In fact, ES7 or better ES2016 is already on it's way.

The most popular transpilers are for sure

- **BabelJS -** formerly ES6-to-5 and used in this tutorial
- **Traceur**

Addy Osmani has a more complete [list of es6-tools on GitHub](https://github.com/addyosmani/es6-tools).

## Tooling

Probably the easiest way to try ES6 now, without having to setup your local workstation is on [jsbin.com](http://jsbin.com).

<figure class="image--medium">
  <img src="/blog/assets/imgs/es6-tutorial/jsbin_es6babel.png">
  <figcaption>Set ES6/Babel on jsbin.com</figcaption>
</figure>

Simply create a new "bin", and choose "ES6/Babel" as your language.

Ok, so now we're setup and ready to get started.

## Block scoping with `let`

ES5 defines scoping of variables quite different than many of the other popular languages which are currently out there. This causes some trouble, especially for novice programmers, but not only. ES5 has so-called **function scope** rather than **block scope** as you'd expect.

```javascript
function someFunc(){
  console.log('entering in someFunc');
  if(true){
    var x = 'Hi there';
  }

  console.log(x);
}
```

This is totally legitimate JavaScript code and prints the following to the console:

```
"entering in someFunc"
"Hi there"
```

As you can see, `x` is visible also outside the if block. While the example above is quite clear, this can lead to quite strange and hard to read code. What's the output of the code?

```javascript
var foo = 1;
function bar() {
    if (!foo) {
        var foo = 10;
    }
    console.log(foo);
}
bar();
```

It prints: `10`.

By using `let`, **ES6 allows you to block scope** your variable, just as you would expected. Let's adapt the above example by changing `var` to `let`:

```javascript
function someFunc(){
  console.log('entering in someFunc');
  if(true){
    let x = 'Hi there';
  }

  console.log(x);
}
someFunc();
```

This time, we get an error. Obviously (would the Java programmer say :wink: ).

```javascript
"entering in someFunc"
"error"
"ReferenceError: x is not defined
    at someFunc (fitusuzuhi.js:9:40)
    at fitusuzuhi.js:11:1
    at https://static.jsbin.com/js/prod/runner-3.29.17.min.js:1:13603
    at https://static.jsbin.com/js/prod/runner-3.29.17.min.js:1:10524"
```

While you **can still use `var`**, the new suggested approach is to switch to `let`. So...start to get accustomed :wink:.

## Redefining variables in your code? Not with ES6, bad boy!

In ES5, this is totally legitimate:

```javascript
var name = 'Juri';
var name = 'Thomas';

console.log(name);
```

Obviously, "re-using" variables is not something you'd want to do but rather there's a good chance you introduced it by accident. I guess you can imagine nasty bugs resulting from this. Luckily **ES6 will throw an error when you redefine the same variable within the same block**. You have to use `let`, however.

```javascript
let name = 'Juri';
let name = 'Thomas';

console.log(name);
```

The result:

<figure class="image--medium">
	<img src="/blog/assets/imgs/es6-tutorial/jsbin-let-redeclarationerror.png">
	<figcaption>Error when re-defining let variables</figcaption>
</figure>

Instead, **redefining the variable within a subscope works**, and results in overriding the previously defined one:

```javascript
(function(){
  let name = 'Juri';
  console.log(name);

  function innerFunc(){
    let name = 'Thomas';
    console.log(name);
  }
  innerFunc();

})();
```

The output is:

```
"Juri"
"Thomas"
```

<p class="notice tip">

</p>

## True constants with `const`

Constants in ES5 were nothing more than simple naming conventions, like prefixing a variable with `const`: `var CONST_PI = 3.141`. Nothing hindered you however to change the value at runtime.

In ES6 finally there's a `const` keyword that does what you'd expect.

```javascript
const pi = 3.141;
pi = 12;
```

It throws an exception at runtime if you try to write on the variable.

<figure class="image--medium">
  <img src="/blog/assets/imgs/es6-tutorial/const-error.png">
  <figcaption>Error when trying to set <code>const</code> fields</figcaption>
</figure>

Watch out however, you can also assign objects to const variables. What is being assigned is the object reference, though. Hence, changing the object reference by assigning another object to the variable won't work, but you can definitely change the object's properties.

```javascript
const myObjConst = {
  name: 'juri'
};

// totally working as you don't
// change the obj reference
myObjConst.name = 'Thomas';

// this will break
myObjConst = { name: 'Thomas' };
```

<p class="notice tip">
  Try it out yourself: <a href="https://jsbin.com/xanede/2/edit?js,console" target="blank">click here</a>
</p>

The **scope of const variables is block scope**, which totally makes sense.

## `...` operator: spread and rest

### spread

Do you remember about `Function.prototype.apply` and `Function.prototype.call`. Not sure how many times I googled for the "apply vs. call" article as I couldn't remember which of the two accepts the array and which one the param series.

`apply` was commonly used to forward an unknown number of function arguments to another function.

```javascript
var wrapper = function(){
  return anotherFunction.apply(null, arguments);
}
```

There are different reasons why one would do this, but I don't want to go into the details of it now. What's important here is that the above code is everything else than readable, right? One immediately thinks: "what does apply do?" and "where does 'arguments' come from?". Overall, it's hard to understand by a non-JavaScript experienced developer.

The spread operator allows us to write our example in a much more elegant way:

```javascript
var wrapper = function(...args){
  return anotherFunction(...args);
}
```

Now it's clear that we're invoking function `anotherFunction` and that we pass along a variable number of arguments that has been passed in by someone else. 

Not only is the spread operator useful for function calls, but also when **manipulating arrays**. Here's a simple scenario: do you know how to concat two arrays in JavaScript?? Like, having one array and pushing the elements of another one into the first?

```javascript
// ES5 code
var names = [
  'Juri',
  'Steffi',
  'Thomas'
];

var anotherSetOfNames = ['Tom', 'Jack'];
names.push.apply(names, anotherSetOfNames);

// you get
// [ 'Juri',  'Steffi',  'Thomas', 'Tom', 'Jack' ];
```

The ES6 code:

```javascript
let names = [
  'Juri',
  'Steffi',
  'Thomas'
];

//adding values
let anotherSetOfNames = ['Tom', 'Jack'];
names.push(...anotherSetOfNames);
```

So much more readable, isn't it? You could even do this:

```javascript
let a1 = [1, 4, 5, 2, 3];
let a2 = [1, 2, ...a1, 3, 44, 2];
```

<p class="notice tip">
  Try it out yourself: <a href="https://jsbin.com/hagoku/6/edit?js,console" target="blank">click here</a>
</p>

### rest

No, it has nothing to do with REST (Representational State Transfer). The rest parameter is the last one in a sequence of function arguments that captures the "rest of the args".

```javascript
function myFunction(a, b, ...args){
  //...
}
```

I'm not even going to detail how to do this in ES5 (let's forget about the past :wink:). It had to do with "slicing" from the `arguments` value the number of args passed to the current function and so on...

## Destructuring assignment

Destructuring assignment is the process of assigning the values of an iterable to variables. PonyFoo also [recently published an in-depth guide on destructuring](http://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-destructuring-in-depth) which you might be interested in.

### Array Destructuring

```javascript
let juri, thomas;
let myArray = ['Juri', 'Thomas'];

// destructuring
[juri, thomas] = myArray;
```

Executing this code, `juri` and `thomas` will get the according values from `myArray` assigned.

<p class="notice tip">
  Try it out yourself: <a href="https://jsbin.com/ripifek/3/edit?js,console" target="blank">click here</a>
</p>

By **combining the destructuring with the ... operator** you get even more interesting use cases (also commonly known from functional programming languages). Extracting the head or tail of a list gets extremely easy.

```javascript
let head, tail;
let names = ['Juri', 'Steffi', 'Thomas', 'Susi'];

[head, ...tail] = names;
// Output:
// head = ['Juri']
// tail = ['Steffi', 'Thomas', 'Susi'];
```

<p class="notice tip">
  Try it out yourself: <a href="https://jsbin.com/megotu/3/edit?js,console" target="blank">click here</a>
</p>

Having this, and with a bit of recursion, a sum function could be defined like..

```javascript
function sum(numbers){
  let head, tail;
  [head, ...tail] = numbers;

  if(numbers.length > 0){
    return head + sum(tail);
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}
```

<p class="notice tip">
  Try it out yourself: <a href="https://jsbin.com/roniyu/2/edit?js,console" target="blank">click here</a>
</p>

There's even more: you can **ignore values when applying** the destructuring operator.

```javascript
let head, tailMinusOne;
let names = ['Juri', 'Steffi', 'Thomas', 'Susi'];

[head, , tailMinusOne] = names;
```

### Object destructuring

Similar as with arrays, destructuring works with objects as well. Even the syntax is similar:

```javascript
let name, age;
let person = {
  name: 'Juri',
  age: 30
};

({name, age} = person);
```

The only thing that might seems strange is the fact you have to wrap the expression with braces.

<p class="notice tip">
  Try it out yourself: <a href="https://jsbin.com/sudofa/3/edit?js,console" target="blank">click here</a>
</p>

Now, in the example above **the variable names have to match the ones from the object**. That might not always be the case. But ES6 has a solution.

```javascript
let x, y;
({name:x, age:y} = { name: 'Juri', age: 30 });
```

You can make it even shorter (not sure that's what you'd want, though):

```javascript
let {name: x, age: y} = { name: 'Juri', age: 30 };
```

### Default values

What if a given value is not present during destructuring? Apply a default!

```javascript
let a, b;
var numbers = [1];

[a,b=0] = numbers;

// Result: b doesn't have a corresponding value, so it'll be set to 0;
```

I'm even more excited about default values for function arguments:

```javascript
function myFunction(a = 0, b = 1, c = 2){
  //...
}
```

Currently you had to write it like

```javascript
function myFunction(a, b, c){
  a = a || 0;
  b = b || 1;
  c = c || 2;

  // ...
}
```

Another interesting use case is to combine **default values together with object destructuring**.

```javascript
// ES5
function printPersonInfo(person){
  var name = (person && person.name) || '(not defined)';
  var age =  (person && person.age) || 18;

  console.log(name, age);
}
printPersonInfo({
  name: 'Juri',
  age: 30
  });
```

This checking is cumbersome, and gets even more weird when having nested objects.

```javascript
// ES6
function printPersonInfo({name = "(not defined)", age = 18 } = {}) {
  console.log(name, age);
}

printPersonInfo({
  name: 'Juri',
  age: 30
});
//"
```

## Arrow functions

If you're a seasoned JavaScript developer, this should look familiar:

```javascript
var that = this;
$('.someButton').click(function(){
  // stupid example
	that.someVariable = 'hi';
});
```

Here it's an example of a jQuery click handler. Notice the `var that = this` line? This is a workaround you have to deal with - mostly when declaring callbacks - in order to adjust the value of `this`. The value of `this` inside the callback points to the function which invoked the callback, and not the outer scope of where the callback has been implemented. Normally, you want to have the latter, which is why "hacks" like `var that = this` or `var self = this` are being used.

<p class="notice tip">
  Try it out yourself: <a href="https://jsbin.com/yufoyo/edit?js,console" target="blank">click here</a>
</p>

jQuery even has a [jQuery.proxy](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/) to help you out with this, but I've rarely seen it being used.

ES2015 introduces arrow functions denoted after their operator: `=>`. They help to cope with these situations.

```javascript
// ES5 function
var someFunction = function(name) { ... }

// ES2015 arrow function
var someFunction = (name) => { ... } 
```

Hence, the above could be rewritten as:

```javascript
$('.someButton').click(() => {
   // this will point to the outer scope now
});
```

## Symbols

Symbols are a fundamental concept introduced in ES6 with the main purpose of using them as object property keys to prevent naming collisions. Read ahead and you'll understand why.

```javascript
let s = Symbol();
```

<p class="notice fact">
 The main purpose of Symbol is to serve as property keys for objects to prevent naming collisions.
</p>

What you need to know

```javascript
let a = Symbol('some key');
let b = Symbol('some key');

console.log(a === b); // prints false

// throws exception; cannot use "new" operator
let c = new Symbol();

// logs "symbol"
console.log(typeof(a));
```

So when are we going to use symbols? Apparently, they have mainly been introduced as keys for object properties and thus to avoid collisions.

```javascript
let x = Symbol();
let obj = {
  [x]: 'Juri'
}

console.log(obj[x]);
```

As you can see, I make use of the concept of **computed properties** mentioned before. To access the property value again, the square brackets `[]` have to be used. It would not work if you write it like `obj.x`.

<p class="notice tip">
  Try it out yourself: <a href="https://jsbin.com/rinima/1/edit?js,console" target="blank">click here</a>
</p>

Another nice feature is the `Symbol.for(..)` function. See yourself

```javascript
let x = Symbol.for('test');

// logs true
console.log(x === Symbol.for('test'));
```

What is this good for you may ask. Well, if you want to use Symbols as keys, you somehow have to make them globally available. `Symbol.for` does that for you as it keeps a registry of key/value pairs.

```javascript
let obj = {};

(function(){
  let s2 = Symbol.for('propName');
  console.log(s2 === Symbol.for('propName'));
  obj[s2] = 'Juri';
})();

// logs "Juri"
console.log(obj[Symbol.for("propName")]);
```

<p class="notice tip">
  Try it out yourself: <a href="https://jsbin.com/qopupe/2/edit?js,console" target="blank">click here</a>
</p>

What might be important to know as well is that you won't get symbols when using `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` but instead you have to use `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()` to retrieve an array of symbols defined on the given object.

<p class="notice tip">
  Symbols are commonly referred to as <code>@@&lt;symbolname&gt;</code>, i.e. <code>@@iterator</code> refers to <code>Symbol.iterator</code>.
</p>

## Iterating Protocol

An **iterator** is an object that implements the iterator protocol.

<div class="notice fact">
  <p>An object is an iterator when it implements a <code>next()</code> method returning an object with the following properties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>done(boolean)</code> - has a value <code>true</code> when the iterator is past the end of the iterated sequence. Otherwise it has the value <code>false</code>.</li>
    <li>
      <code>value</code> - any JavaScript value that represents the value extracted from the iterated sequence. This value my be omitted when <code>done</code> is <code>true</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

Let's create such an iterator object:

```javascript
let people = {
  list: ['Juri', 'Steffi', 'Thomas', 'Jack'],
  nextIdx: 0,
  next: function(){
    if(this.nextIdx < this.list.length){
      return {
        value: this.list[this.nextIdx++],
        done: false
      };
    }else{
      return { done: true };
    }
  }
}
```

<p class="notice tip">
  Try it out yourself: <a href="https://jsbin.com/sigilu/1/edit?js,console" target="blank">click here</a>
</p>

An **iterable object** needs to implement such an iterator object by exposing it through the **@@iterator** (`Symbol.iterator`) method. Applying this to our previous object:

```javascript
let people = {
  list: ['Juri', 'Steffi', 'Thomas', 'Jack'],
  nextIdx: 0,
  [Symbol.iterator]: function(){
    return {
      list: this.list,
      nextIdx: this.nextIdx,
      next: function(){
        if(this.nextIdx < this.list.length){
          return {
            value: this.list[this.nextIdx++],
            done: false
          };
        }else{
          return { done: true };
        }
      }
    };
  }
};
```

<p class="notice tip">
  Try it out yourself: <a href="https://jsbin.com/doriwi/2/edit?js,console" target="blank">click here</a>
</p>

What we can now do is to use the new `for...of` loop introduced in ES6:

```javascript
let people = {
  list: ['Juri', 'Steffi', 'Thomas', 'Jack'],
  nextIdx: 0,
  [Symbol.iterator]: function(){
    ...
  }
};

for(let val of people){
  console.log(val);
}
```

## Generators

## Tail call optimization

## Reflect API

ES6 introduces a new `Reflect` object with a set of new methods for object reflection. This new API is intended to be a more easier and concise version of the partly already existing ES5 reflection API. Therefore you might encounter some methods that sound similar :smile:.

A good reference is also the [MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect). In the following I quickly outline them.

### Reflect.apply(fn, obj, args)

Just like `Function.apply`.

### Reflect.construct(target, args)

### Reflect.defineProperty(target, name, desc)

### Reflect.deleteProperty(target, name)

### Reflect.enumerate(target)

### Reflect.get(target, name, [receiver])

Proxy traps:

```javascript
var loggedObj = new Proxy(obj, {
  get: function(target, name) {
    console.log("get", target, name);
    return Reflect.get(target, name);
  }
});
```

## Reflect.set(target, name, value, [receiver])

### Reflect.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(target, name)

### Reflect.getPrototypeOf(target)

### Reflect.setPrototypeOf(target, newProto)

### Reflect.has(target, name)

### Reflect.isExtensible(target)

### Reflect.preventExtension(target)

### Reflect.ownKeys(target)

## Classes

Against many JavaScript critics (mostly those not knowing JavaScript well enough), the language is fully object oriented. Creating a new instance of an object in ES5 is as simple as

```javascript
var aPerson = {
	firstname: 'Juri',
	surname: 'Strumpflohner',
	age: 29,
	getFullName: function() {
		return this.firstname + ' ' + this.surname;
	}
};
```

In this way you directly create and instantiate a new class and you can use it right away:

```javascript
aPerson.age = 30;
console.log(aPerson.getFullName());
```

As you can see you can set properties and invoke methods/functions on the object itself.  
There's another way of defining an object in ES5, using a so-called constructor function and then extending that one through the object's prototype.

```javascript
function Person(firstname, surname) {
  this.firstname = firstname;
  this.surname = surname;
}

Person.prototype.getFullName = function() {
	return this.firstname + ' ' + this.surname;
}
```

To be able to use such class, it **has to be instantiated** using the `new` keyword.

```javascript
var aPerson = new Person('Juri', 'Strumpflohner');
aPerson.age = 30; // totally valid
console.log(aPerson.getFullName());
```

Most server-side developers feel a lot more comfortable with this approach. I mean, the first line of instantiating the person is completely valid C# code!  
There are long debates on the web (simply google for prototypal vs. classical inheritance) about whether this is a good thing or not. I'm not going to outline it here now. Stuff from the past :wink:.

### Class definition

**ES2015** has native support for classes...and the discussions around them continue. But let's look at the technical details:

```javascript

class Person {
  
  constructor(firstname, surname) {
    this._firstname = firstname;
    this._surname = surname;
  }
  
  get firstname() {
    return this._firstname;
  }
  
  getFullName() {
    // woohoooo template strings!!
    return `${this._firstname} ${this._surname}`;
  }
  
}

let aPerson = new Person('Juri', 'Strumpflohner');
console.log(aPerson.getFullName());
console.log(aPerson.firstname);
```

Simple, isn't it? Without telling you I used another cool feature in the `getFullName()` function: _template strings_. But more about that later.

Another important thing is that **classes are NOT hoisted**, meaning that - unlike with functions - you can't invoke/instantiate a class before it is defined.

### Getters and setters

Classes can have getters and setters for properties which is as simple as placing `get` or `set` before the method.

```javascript
class Person {
	...

	get firstname() {
		return this._firstname;
	}
	set firstname(name) {
		this._firstname = name;
	}
	…
}
```

</p>

### Static methods

Static methods can be defined as follows:

```javascript
class Person {

	static sayHello() {
		console.log('Hi');
	}

}
```

### Inheritance

**Did you ever try inheritance in ES5??** You have to make use of the prototype chain and connect the objects between them. See the code link below.

<p class="notice tip">
  Try it out yourself: <a href="https://jsbin.com/yewido/latest/edit?js,console" target="blank">click here</a>
</p>

Understanding how the prototype chain works is not that hard, but reading that code is a total mess.

I gave it a go to rewrite the above example in ES2015.

<p class="notice tip">
  Try it out yourself: <a href="https://jsbin.com/seyami/edit?js,console" target="blank">click here</a>
</p>

Not sure about you, but for me this is so much more readable. It's mostly syntactic sugar, but a lot cleaner. And note, the usage is exactly the same!

### Dynamic method names

Method names can be determined at runtime as well. Just in ES5 you could call a property/function on an object using the array notation `aPerson['firstname']`, you can also define such methods in ES2015 classes:

```javascript

class Person {
  
  ['my' + 'DynamicName']() {
    console.log('Hi');
  }
  
}

console.log(new Person().myDynamicName());
```

Obviously works also with static methods. An interesting use case for such dynamic or computed properties is when you use a ES2015 Symbol datatype as the name of the method. Think about it.

## Modules

Personally, modules are the thing I like most about ES2015. So far there were different approaches to modules in browser applications. 

The easiest form, an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):

```javascript
(function(exports, dep1, dep2) {
	var myModule = {
		doSomething: function() {
			// …
		}
	};

	// attach it to window or whatever
	// to make it globally available
	exports.myModule = myModule;

})(window, dependency1, dependency2);
```

The main objective: create private scope, avoid naming collisions and selectively publish functionality to the outside world. But as soon as "dependency1" and "dependency2" have to be asynchronously loaded, things get messy.

This is where AMD and CommonJS come into play, aiming to standardise how modules are created and loaded. Addy Osmani wrote an entire [online article](http://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/) on how to write modular JavaScript.

So basically what you had so far was

```javascript
define('myModule', [
	'dependency1',
	'dependency2',
	...,
	],
	function(dep1, dep2,…) {
		// the code of my module
		var myModule = {
			doSomething: function() {
				// use dep1, dep2,…
			}
		};
		
		return myModule;
	}
);
```

What suffers most: readability. The nesting level is high, even though one can somehow mitigate it with good indentation.

The same **module definition in ES2015**:

```javascript
import dep1 from 'dependency1';
import dep2 from 'dependency2';

export default myModule = {
	doSomething: function() {
		// …
	}
};
```

Nice, isn't it?

Very simplified, a module supports two kinds of exports:

- default export (can only be one)
- named export

The shouldn't be mixed. For example:

```javascript
// mathStuff.js: named exports
function sum(a,b) {
  return a + b;
}
function divide(a,b) {
  return a/b;
}

export { sum, divide as div };
```

In this way externally, the module could be consumed with

```javascript
import { sum, div } from './mathStuff';
```

Similarly, if we convert the above example to a default export it'll look like

```javascript
// mathStuff.js: named exports
function sum(a,b) {
  return a + b;
}
function divide(a,b) {
  return a/b;
}

export default {
	sum: sum,
	div: divide
};
```

..which would then be consumed as

```javascript
import mathUtils from './mathStuff';
```
