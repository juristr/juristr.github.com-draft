Yes I got also caught by the iPhone fever :). I'm right now writing this post using the iPhone:)<br />It will need some time till i get accustomed to it but its functionalities are really amazing and browsing the web is really great, nearly like on a normal browser (well actually it uses a Safari implementation)<br />Cool...lets see how it's going on, till now I'm convinced :D
