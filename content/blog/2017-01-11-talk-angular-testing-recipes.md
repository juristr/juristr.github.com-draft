<div class="article-intro">
  I recently wanted to dive deeper into testing Angular applications, in specific on how to write proper unit tests for some common scenarious you might encounter. <a href="https://twitter.com/webdave_de" target="_blank">Dave</a>, the organizer of <a href="https://twitter.com/angular_hamburg" target="_blank">the Angular Hamburg Meetup group</a> asked me whether I'd be interested in doing a talk. So here we are, read on for the slides, GitHub repo and video of the talk :wink:.

## Code Repository

I setup a dedicated code repository with the purpose of collecting **testing recipes for various scenarious** you might encounter while testing your Angular applications.

{{<article-link

	title="GitHub: angular-testing-recipes"
	text="A code repository full of testing recipes. Check them out and help me create more!"
