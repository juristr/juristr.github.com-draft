Today I had to create a new view inside on an Eclipse RCP application representing data inside a table. I found the
following article<br />
<div style="text-align: center;"><b><a href="http://www.vogella.de/articles/EclipseJFaceTable/article.html">http://www.vogella.de/articles/EclipseJFaceTable/article.html</a></b></div>which
you may be interested in. It perfectly illustrates everything you need for creating a table with clear code examples.
