I've already published a couple of Git guides on my blog here

- [Git Explained: For Beginners](/blog/2013/04/git-explained/)
- [Implementing the "Git flow"](/blog/2014/09/implementing-the-git-flow/)
- [Git Flow with Jenkins and GitLab](/blog/2014/01/git-flow-jenkins-gitlab/)

The main reason is because I needed it as a documentation for my work mates. When you switch from TFS to Git, you need some conventions and these articles worked out amazingly. Our Git workflow somehow followed the "Git flow" although it wasn't that strict at all....we were somewhere in between the Git flow and the GitHub flow. Now with this article I know, we did **GitLab flow** :smiley:.

If you're working a lot with Git you should definitely check it out. GitLab is an awesome platform as well, btw.
