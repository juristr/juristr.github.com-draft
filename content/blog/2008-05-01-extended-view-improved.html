I've <a href="http://blog.js-development.com/2008/04/extended-view-full-focus-on-readers.html">recently written</a> about the "extended view" feature I've implemented on my blog here. Today I improved it. Now it automatically saves your last view mode such that the next time you can immediately start reading from you preferred one. For instance if you leave the page in extended view, this view mode will be automatically restored the next time you visit my blog.<br />Technically speaking I realized this by saving down a cookie with JavaScript which is read the next time you come back..so nothing exciting actually :) Clearly your browser must accept cookies, otherwise it won't work.
