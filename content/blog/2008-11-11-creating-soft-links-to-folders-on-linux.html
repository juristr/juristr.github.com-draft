If you're working on Linux, especially on the command line, you'll often have to navigate through a lot of directories. This clearly depends on your directory structure, but it may be the case. That's however really annoying, so creating a link may easy your life:<br /><pre class="code">ln -s &lt;fileonharddisk&gt; &lt;name&gt;<br /></pre><br />(Thanks to <a href="http://matthias.jimdo.com/">Matthias Braunhofer</a>)
