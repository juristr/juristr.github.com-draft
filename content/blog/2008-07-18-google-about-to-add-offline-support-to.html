I did already wonder how long it will take for Google to extend their <a href="http://gearsblog.blogspot.com/">mission of teaching web-apps to work offline</a> on its remaining major services after adding it to Google Reader and Google Docs.<br />Now <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2008/07/gmail-and-google-calendar-to-add.html">some notices appeared</a> that Google is about to add offline support to Gmail and Google Calendar.
