It's always nice when people contribute to your articles through comments or by resharing it with their mates. That said, I'm happy to announce that <strong>Philippe Poumaroux translated this article into French</strong>. So, if you're interested, you can find it <a href="http://philippe.poumaroux.free.fr/index.php?post/2014/09/06/Node%2C-Grunt%2C-Bower-et-Yeoman-Une-bo%C3%AEte-%C3%A0-outils-pour-le-d%C3%A9veloppeur-web-moderne" target="blank">here</a>.
