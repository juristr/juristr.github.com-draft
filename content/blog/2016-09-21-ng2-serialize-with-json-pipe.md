<div class="article-intro">
	A powerful way of debugging, especially templates, in Angular 1 was the JSON pipe (or filter) which could be used within a template. The pipe still natively exists in Angular. Here's how you can import and use it.
</div>

{{< postad >}}

{{<warn-notice message="$1" >}}
 

Especially when you have to debug your Angular templates it was particularly useful in Angular 1 to use the JSON filter.

```html
{% raw %}
<h1>Some template</h1>
<pre>{{ myObj | json }}</pre>
{% endraw %}
```

As a result you got a nicely formatted JSON representation of your databound JavaScript object.

## Use the JSONPipe in Angular

The very same holds for Angular, which has [a built-in JSONPipe object](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/JsonPipe-pipe.html) as well.

To use it you have to import the `CommonModule` from the `@angular/common` package into your own module.

```javascript
{% raw %}
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';


@NgModule({
    ...
    imports: [ CommonModule ]
    ...
})
{% endraw %}
```

Then you can start using it in your template, just as you did in Angular 1.

```javascript
{% raw %}
@Component({
    selector: 'my-app',
    template: `
      <pre>{{ myObj | json }}</pre>
    `
})
export class MyAppComponent {
    myObj: any;

    constructor() {
        this.myObj = {
            name: 'Juri',
            website: 'http://juristr.com',
            twitter: '@juristr'
        };
    }
}
{% endraw %}
```

Easy, isn't it :wink:.
