I recently had a problem when using Spring's SimpleFormController together with validation. So I posted on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>, got an answer, that didn't work out so I found a solution and answered to myself :)<br /><br />Since redundancy is bad, here's the link to my post:<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><b><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/788630/keeping-request-parameters-on-spring-simpleformcontroller-with-validator">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/788630/keeping-request-parameters-on-spring-simpleformcontroller-with-validator</a></b></div>
