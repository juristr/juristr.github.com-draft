If you're developing on Eclipse RCP applications it may be interesting to save the perspective layout and open views of
the user s.t. when he launches the application the next time, everything looks as before. That may sound difficult but
actually it is really simple.<br />In your ApplicationWorkbenchAdvisor.java, in the initialize(IWorkbenchConfigurer)
just write the following:<br /><br />
<pre class="prettyprint">public class ApplicationWorkbenchAdvisor extends WorkbenchAdvisor {<br />   ...<br /><br />   @Override<br />   public void initialize(IWorkbenchConfigurer configurer) {<br />      super.initialize(configurer);<br />      configurer.setSaveAndRestore(true);<br />      ...<br />   }<br /><br />   ...<br />}<br /></pre>This
should work fine. In case it doesn't, try to get the WorkbenchConfigurer by calling the method getWorkbenchConfigurer()
and invoke the setSaveAndRestore(...) on that.
