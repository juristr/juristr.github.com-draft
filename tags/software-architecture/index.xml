      <description>Cool guy talking about the cost of abstractions and why you should often step out and critically look at what you do. Don&amp;rsquo;t do it because you always have done it like that.</description>

      <description>JavaScript programming has evolved a lot over the past years and has somehow revolutionized the way you develop on the web.
