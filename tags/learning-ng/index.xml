      <description>Angular directives can have a separate, isolated scope, which is even the suggested approach most of the time. And they can have directive controllers.

      <description>This might create quite some debugging headaches, especially in a larger application. Things don&amp;rsquo;t bind properly, have different data on the scope than you&amp;rsquo;d expect etc.</description>
