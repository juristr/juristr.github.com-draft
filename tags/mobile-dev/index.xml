      <description>Google App Engine is great for those of you in search of a complete, scalable&amp;nbsp;and affordable hosting solution. Especially if you start a project and you don&#39;t yet know exactly how successful it&#39;ll be (which mostly you never know), how much potential users you&#39;ll have and so on, then App Engine is great.</description>

      <description>Couple of time ago I wrote a blog post describinghow you can use Dropbox for deploying your Android APK basically over-the-air to your device. That involved copying your APK to a dedicated Dropbox folder that can then be accessed from your Android device to install it.</description>

      <description>As you might already know, Android comes with a preinstalled SQLite database. This is quite handy because you can rely on it without the need to care about installing a DB along with your application (although you can, standalone, small DB&#39;s of course like HSQLDB).</description>

      <description>Today I took the chance (and a bit of free time) to upgrade to the latest Android SDK release, namely Gingerbread. Experience has shown that you better back up your Eclipse as well as currently installed Android SDK folder, especially if you&#39;re working on an important project (which I consider my Master thesis project to be kind of ;)).</description>

      <title>HowTo: Get an Android app&#39;s database from the emulator</title>
      <link>https://juristr.com/blog/2010/06/howto-get-android-apps-database-from/</link>

      <guid>https://juristr.com/blog/2010/06/howto-get-android-apps-database-from/</guid>
      <description>Most apps need a database for storing their data onto the device in a structured form. Android&#39;s natively supported DB is SQLite. Now of course if you develop an app you&#39;ll probably have the need for inspecting the stored data during development.</description>

      <description>Comment
Nice talk that gives insight in an approach for cross-compiling Android targeted apps to the iPhone (but not only). The idea is to overcome the problem of coding the mobile app for multiple platforms which often is just not feasible due to time and skills.</description>
