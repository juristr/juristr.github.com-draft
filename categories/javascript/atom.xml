      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure you heard about Angular 2 and that it will be totally different. Forget everything you know and start from scratch 😮 .

      <description>When you create isolated directives, you usually use the scope property to define your directive&#39;s external API. Some of the APIs properties might be mandatory while others are optional and based on that state, your directive might react differently.</description>

      <description>JavaScript MVC architectures are a de-facto standard when you create complex single-page JavaScript applications. But it doesn&#39;t stop here. MVC helps to separate reponsibilities for coordinating the data (model) and visualization (view), but it doesn&#39;t have a concept for coordination among an application&#39;s modules or widgets as you might call them.</description>

      <description>JavaScript programming has evolved a lot over the past years and has somehow revolutionized the way you develop on the web. While many initially just used it as a scripting language to quickly hack in some dynamic behavior into traditional websites, it starts now to be used much more like a fully capable programming language (mainly also due to many emerging JavaScript libraries and more capable browsers).</description>

      <description>When &#34;seriously&#34; developing JavaScript applications we obviously need to write tests. Being a fully dynamic language (similar as Ruby), tests are more necessary than ever since there is no compiler that checks for you all the silly mistakes before you run your code the first time.</description>
