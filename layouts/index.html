                I've been working as a software developer and architect for 10+ years, with technologies like Java,
                .Net,
                Node.js on the desktop, mobile as well as web. Lately I'm mostly focusing on frontend web development
                with JavaScript, on writing
                technical articles, teaching and consulting.

            <p>
                In November 2017 I officially became a <strong>Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies</strong>. I
                feel
                so honored to be part of this amazing group of experts from all around the world. Being a GDE gives me
                special insights and allows me to directly connect with Google Engineers, helping me to better support
                the community.

                <strong>What is a GDE?</strong> We're not Google employees, but rather it's a recognition by Google
                Inc. as having exemplary expertise in a given technology or product field. More <a href="https://developers.google.com/experts/about"

                I love to give presentations. To study complex topics, digest them, make them visually appealing and
                easy to
                grasp. It's probably part of why I like to teach as well. By the end of 2017 (quite late actually) I
                started to also give public talks, at meetups and conferences and I've been doing that since then
                (whenever my time allows me to do so).

                I always loved to share my knowledge with others, out of which my passion for teaching has grown.
                Besides my courses on Egghead, I've been teaching over a dozen on-site workshops at different
                companies.
            </p>

                <strong>How am I different?</strong> I'm a professional software developer, not only having years of
                experience in quite a broad range of backend and frontend development, but I <strong>still develop
                    enterprise
                    software on a daily basis.</strong> By doing so and by talking to different companies I have a
                unique
                perspective on the day-to-day problems that arise when creating large enterprise applications.

                appreciated Egghead because of its focus on quality and conciseness. Time is rare which is why Egghead
                places a particular focus on creating short, concise bite-sized videos.
