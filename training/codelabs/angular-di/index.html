        <p>Similar to other (more backend) languages and frameworks, Angular has a dependency injection mechanism.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Dependency Injection (DI)?</strong></h2>
<p>Using a DI mechanism has a variety of advantages. We don&#39;t have to instantiate the objects by hand. This can be quite important especially when it comes to instantiating an entire tree of services with all of it dependencies. Moreover, the DI container controls the lifetime of our services and thus helps us improve the memory management as we don&#39;t get duplicate instances of the same service in memory (if we don&#39;t want to).</p>
<p>Finally, it greatly improves testability by allowing us to arbitrarily inject &#34;mock instances&#34; of a given service during testing.</p>
<h2 class="checklist"><strong>What you&#39;ll learn</strong></h2>

      <google-codelab-step label="Exercise: Overwrite an existing service" duration="4">
        <p><a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-wrkshop-di-exoverwriting" target="_blank"><paper-button class="colored" raised>Open starting example</paper-button></a></p>
<p>You should see the following screen:</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 624.00px" src="img/5c39900be0d5cc37.png"></p>
<p>The example is structured in the following way.</p>
<pre><code>import { Component } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;

@Component({
 selector: &#39;app-root&#39;,
 template: `
   &lt;h1&gt;Angular Services&lt;/h1&gt;

   &lt;h3&gt;App Component&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;app-person&gt;&lt;/app-person&gt;
   &lt;app-woman&gt;&lt;/app-woman&gt;
 `
})
export class AppComponent {}</code></pre>
<p>As you can see we have the <code>AppComponent</code> that loads two different components, the <code>&lt;app-person&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;app-woman&gt;</code>. Both components (as can be seen from the screenshot above) show the same data which they get from the <strong>PersonService</strong>. To illustrate this example, the &lt;app-woman&gt; component also includes the &lt;app-person&gt; component again, which is why the data is shown twice.</p>
<p><strong>Inspect the source code</strong> to understand the starting example.</p>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Create a new WomanService. The new service should inherit from the already existing PeopleService, thus expose the same public API. However, in the WomanService, you should overwrite the <code>getPerson()</code> function in the following way:</p>
<pre><code> getPerson() {
   const person = super.getPerson();
   person.name = &#39;Katie&#39;;
   person.gender = &#39;F&#39;;
   return person;
 }</code></pre>
<p>The WomanService should be injected in a way that the &lt;app-woman&gt; component doesn&#39;t get the global PeopleService instance, but rather a dedicated instance of the newly created WomanService.</p>
<p>The end result should look as follows:</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 624.00px" src="img/9c205b0329e0e2d9.png"></p>

<p>You should see the following screen:</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 624.00px" src="img/c206a6e2d091b1de.png"></p>
<p>Clicking the &#34;Log to console&#34; button gives a message &#34;Logger: Message from PersonComponent&#34;. The PersonComponent basically gets a LoggerService injected and simply invokes its log(..) function to print to the console.</p>
<pre><code>import { Component, OnInit } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;
import { LoggerService } from &#39;./services/logger.service&#39;;

@Component({
 selector: &#39;app-person&#39;,
 template: `
   &lt;div&gt;
   Logging component:
   &lt;button (click)=&#34;doLog()&#34;&gt;Log to console&lt;/button&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 `,
 styles: []
})
export class PersonComponent implements OnInit {
 constructor(private logger: LoggerService) {}

 ngOnInit() {}

 doLog() {
   this.logger.log(&#39;Message from PersonComponent&#39;);
 }
}</code></pre>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>There is already an existing <code>NewLoggerService</code> present. Register the service in a way that the entire application now gets the NewLoggerService instance instead of the existing <code>LoggerService</code>.</p>
<p>Upon successful completion you should see the following result in your console when clicking the log button:</p>

<p>When starting the example you see the following</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 624.00px" src="img/1b91172642cf0eff.png"></p>
<p>The example is currently broken and part of the exercise is to fix it. In the example there is a <code>LoggerService</code> and <code>ConsoleWriter</code>. The <code>LoggerService</code> takes a boolean indicating whether the logging is enabled or not, and a <code>ConsoleWriter</code> instance which is responsible for writing the log.</p>
<pre><code>import { Injectable } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;
import { ConsoleWriter } from &#39;./console-writer.service&#39;;

@Injectable()
export class LoggerService {
 constructor(private isEnabled: boolean, private writer: ConsoleWriter) {}

 log(msg: string) {
   if (this.isEnabled) {
     this.writer.write(msg);
   }
 }
}</code></pre>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Register the LoggerService in a way that</p>
<ul>
<li>It gets a true as boolean value, thus activating the logging</li>
<li>It gets an instance of a ConsoleWriter</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> use a factory to instantiate the LoggerService. <strong>Do not instantiate</strong> the <code>ConsoleWriter</code> by yourself (although in this simple example you totally could), but rather get it via the dependency injection mechanism.</p>
<p>Upon successful completion you should see the following result in your console when clicking the log button:</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Exercise: Avoid multiple service instances in lazy loaded modules" duration="4">
        <p><a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-wrkshop-di-lazyloading-issue" target="_blank"><paper-button class="colored" raised>Open starting example</paper-button></a></p>
<p>In this example we have a small mini-app that navigates between the screens using the Angular router. We have a <code>HomeComponent</code> that gets activated when navigating to <code>/home</code> and a module EmployeesModule that gets lazily loaded by the app when navigating to <code>/employees</code>. </p>
<p>Moreover we have a <code>PeopleModule</code> that contains some common functionality, such as a <code>PeopleService</code> holding the app state as well as a <code>PersonListComponent</code> visualizing the people from the <code>PeopleService</code>.</p>
<p>Both the <code>HomeComponent</code> (registered directly on the <code>AppModule</code>) as well as the <code>EmployeesComponent</code> internally use the PeopleListComponent to visualize a list of people. For being able to do so, they <strong>both import the </strong><strong><code>PeopleModule</code></strong> in their imports section.</p>
<p><img style="max-width: 624.00px" src="img/d2d065fbe8f61167.png"></p>
<p>Inspect the source code.</p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>If you played with the example, you might have already spotted the &#34;problem&#34;. We mentioned that both screens use the PeopleModule and its PeopleService and <code>PeopleListComponent</code> to visualize a list of people. The PeopleService is meant to hold our application state. However, if we add a new person on the &#34;home screen&#34; and then jump to the &#34;Employees screen&#34; by clicking the link, <strong>we get a different list</strong>. </p>
<p>The reason being is that we have <strong>two different instances of the PeopleService</strong> in memory, both holding their respective list of people. Most of the times, this is not the desired behavior.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Angular has a root dependency injector, which holds all of the services. When a new service is requested by some Component or another Service, Angular walks up the dependency tree until the root injector to get the correct instance. <strong>Lazy loaded modules have their injector instance.</strong> Thus, since in our example we import the <code>PeopleModule</code> on both, the AppModule as well as the <code>EmployeesModule</code>, the <code>PeopleService</code> (contained in the <code>PeopleModule</code>) will be registered on both dependency injectors.</p>
<p>Registering the PeopleModule only at the AppModule level is not a solution, because in that way we wouldn&#39;t be able to consume the <code>PeopleListComponent</code> in the <code>EmployeeModule</code>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see who to solve this.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Solving the multiple service instances problem (Solution 1)" duration="0">
        <p>One way to solve this issue is by registering the shared module&#39;s (<code>PeopleModule</code>) providers only once, at the <code>AppModule</code> level. Using the <code>ModuleWithProviders</code> interface we can separate the registration of the providers and the components.</p>
<p>Open the <code>PeopleModule</code> and implement the so-called <code>forRoot()</code> pattern.</p>
<pre><code>...
@NgModule({
 imports: [CommonModule],
 declarations: [PeopleListComponent],
 exports: [PeopleListComponent]
})
export class PeopleModule {
 static forRoot(): ModuleWithProviders {
   return {
     ngModule: PeopleModule,
     providers: [PeopleService]
   };
 }
}</code></pre>
<p>Note that there is no more <code>providers: [..]</code> part in the <code>@NgModule</code>. It has been moved to the <code>forRoot()</code> function.</p>
<p>While we do not need to change anything in the <code>EmployeesModule</code>, open the AppModule and rather than simply importing the <code>PeopleModule</code>, we call the <code>forRoot()</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>...

@NgModule({
 declarations: [AppComponent, HomeComponent],
 imports: [..., PeopleModule.forRoot()],
 bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}</code></pre>
<p>In this way the providers are <strong>only registered in the AppModule</strong>.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a working solution.</p>

      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Solving the multiple service instances problem (Solution 2)" duration="0">
        <p>Starting with Angular version 6, we have a new way of registering services, namely with the <code>providedIn: ‘r</code>oot&#39; option.</p>
<p><strong>Remove the PeopleService registration from the PeopleModule</strong> and use the new providedIn option for registering services:</p>
<pre><code>import { Injectable } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;

@Injectable({
 providedIn: &#39;root&#39;
})
export class PeopleService {
  ...
}</code></pre>
<p>If you now test the example again, it should be working as intended. Aside from some other advantages, the <code>providedIn</code> option makes sure the service exists <strong>exactly once</strong>, even when lazy loaded in various modules.</p>
